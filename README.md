# Capstone: Audit Lab

## Description

In this project I conducted a practical, hands-on, auditing lab specifically using [NIST SP 800-53](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) 3.1 Media Protection (MP-1 through MP-8) controls.
The primary objective was to enhance the organization's information systems security practices.
    
### Key Points
  - Control Analysis: Analyzed Media Protection controls (MP-1 through MP-8) to understand their effectiveness.
  - Data Collection: Conducted a comprehensive audit using interviews, testing, and meticulous documentation.
  - Evidence Detail: Gathered comprehensive evidence through interviews, documented policies, and recorded key personnel discussions to ensure a robust audit trail.

### Objectives
  - Assessed compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Media Protection controls (MP-1 through MP-8).
  - Provided well-documented evidence to support objective audit conclusions.
  - Leveraged effective audit practices to recommend improvements and enhance the organization's cybersecurity posture.

## Step 1: Preparation
To optimize efficiency and respect everyone's schedule, pre-audit meetings were held with relevant personnel, outlining discussion topics and proactively requesting Standard Operating Procedures and the System Security Plan in advance.

## Step 2: NIST 800-53 Audit
I conducted an audit using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 security controls, focusing on controls related to protecting media (MP-1 through MP-8) found in section 3.10. <br>

## Step 3: Control Family Understanding 
I mapped the Media Protection control family (NIST 800-53 section 3.10) - controls MP-1 through MP-8 - into a spreadsheet for analysis. <br>

## Step 4: Data Collection
Data collection involved interviews, testing, or documentation. <br>
ex. evidence of Policy and Procedures (MP-1) was gathered through an interview, requiring thorough documentation of key insights. <br>

## Step 5: Evidence Details  
The interview with John Connor, Director of IT, provided evidence on the organization's existing Media Protection policies and procedures. <br>

## Step 6: Findings
Based on the evidence from the interview with John, the finding was that "No media protection policy or procedures were available." <br>

## Step 7: Disposition
The audit identified a lack of media protection policies and procedures. <br/>

## Step 8: Rinse and Repeat  
Evaluated controls MP-2 through MP-8 using a combination of interviews, testing, and document reviews, following the same approach as steps 5-8. <br>
